Module 2 Challenge VBA
Resources:
Max and I collaberated on some of the code, We worked on the If statement for OpenPrice <> 0 Then
I got the application.Worksheet function for the SUM on https://www.automateexcel.com/vba/sum-function/


Max and I also collaberated on the color Index. I think we found that code on Microsofts website. 
I also read multiple articles and watched some youtube videos to get more of an understanding what I was trying to do. I didn't save all of them, but here is one https://data36.com/python-nested-loops-if-statements-combined-data-sciene/

I still need to add the Greatest Percentage Increase/Decrease and The Greatest Total Volume. I set up a tutoring session for Saturday, So I'll definatly have it complete by the end of the weekend. I'm getting some errors about Run Time error 1004. The code can't be too far off because it's populating the given collumns with some sort of pattern. I just don't know enough yet to know what's wrong.
